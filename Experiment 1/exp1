Title : Implementation Of Various Commands In Linux

 1. Whatis :

            It displays the manual page description in a single line of the command that passes with the whatis command. 
            It searches for the strings that have been passed with it from its index databases.

                      -v -- verbose, prints verbose warning message
                      -r -- regex, interprets each keyword as regex
                      -w -- wildcard, the keyword contains wild card
                      -h -- help, gives the general syntax along with the various options that can be used
            Example : 
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % Whatis ls
                      > NAME
                        ls – list directory contents

                      SYNOPSIS
                         ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when]
                         [-D format] [file ...]

                      DESCRIPTION

 3. Type : 
            The type command in Linux is a useful utility for identifying how the shell will interpret a given command. 
            It provides information on whether a command is a shell built-in, external binary, function, or alias, helping 
            users understand the source of the command and its behavior.
            
            Command : $ type [Options] command names
            Example : 
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % type type 
                      > type is a shell builtin
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % type PWD
                      > PWD is /bin/PWD
    
 4. Date Command : 
            date command is used to display the system date and time. 
            date command is also used to set date and time of the system. 
            By default the date command displays the date in the time zone on which unix/linux operating system is configured.
            You must be the super-user (root) to change the date and time. 

            Command: $ date
            Example : ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % date
                      > Tue Nov 19 11:37:19 IST 2024
 5. Echo Command : 
                  The echo command in Linux is a built-in command that allows users to display lines of text or strings that are passed as arguments. 
                  It is commonly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

            Command : $ echo [option] [string]
            Example : 
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % echo Om Magdum
                      > Om Magdum
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % x=5 
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % echo $x
                      > 5
 6. Printf Command:
                  The ‘printf’ command in Linux is a versatile tool used to display formatted text, numbers, or other data types directly in the terminal.

            Command : $printf [-v var] format [arguments]
            Example :
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % printf "%s \n" "Hello, World"
                      > Hello, World 
                      ommagdum@Oms-MacBook-Air ~ % printf "%d \n" 10
                      > 10
